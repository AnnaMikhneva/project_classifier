# Project
### Classifier for annotation verification
#### Mikhneva Anna
The purpose of my work was to create a trained classifier that will be able to determine the suitability of an annotation for use, that is, its quality and informativeness.\ 
The main steps of the project were:
1. data collection from openalex (file "r script.R")
2. data markup for our purposes using the first classifier and error matrices that were output, as well as dataset analysis (files "preprocessing.ipynb" and "classificator1.ipynb")
3. vectorization, vector dimensionalization and annotation visualization ("vizualization.ipynb")
4. Application of 4 machine learning models to data ("classificator2.ipynb") \
\
The "graphics" folder contains scatter plots that result from the visualization of vectorized annotations. The "matrix" folder contains annotations from error matrices after applying various models.
